<h3>info:An Iron Farm is a type of automated farming system in the game Minecraft used for farming iron golems. Iron golems are large, strong mobs that drop iron ingots and roses when killed. In an Iron Farm, players create a structure with enough villagers and doors to generate iron golems, then use redstone circuitry and pistons to trap and kill them. The drops can be collected and used for various purposes, such as trading with villagers or crafting.</h3>
